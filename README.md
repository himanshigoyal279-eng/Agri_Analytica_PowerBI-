# Agri_Analytica_PowerBI-
This is an Agricultural Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI for a data visualization portfolio project.
The dashboard provides a comprehensive, district-level view of Indian agriculture by analyzing the relationship between crop performance and various environmental factors—in data cleaning, DAX calculations, data modeling, and creating interactive, production-ready business intelligence visualizations.
## Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI Desktop: The primary tool used for data connection, transformation (Power Query), data modeling (Relationships and DAX), and visualization.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used within Power BI to create custom measures, calculated columns, and complex time-intelligence calculations.
Microsoft Excel / CSV: The initial format of the raw data files (.csv and the original .xlsx file) before being loaded into Power BI.
Power Query (M Language): Utilized within Power BI to clean, shape, merge, and transform the raw data into a star schema model, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance.
## Key Features
Crop Yield vs. Environment: Visually correlates the historical Yield (Kg per ha) of key crops (Rice, Wheat, Pearl Millet, etc.) with localized Annual Rainfall (mm) and regional Soil Type to identify optimal growing conditions and potential environmental risks.
Regional Performance: Utilizes geographical filters to conduct a deep-dive analysis by State and District on metrics like Area, Production, and Yield.
Data-Driven Decisions: The final report provides actionable insights for resource allocation and yield optimization strategies.
